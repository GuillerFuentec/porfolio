      status: "This project is finished",
      overview: `This project, developed by me, is a drum machine
                          application. It is part of a larger collection of
                          projects in the Libraries-Projects repository on
                          GitHub.`,
      //
      design: `The application's interface is simple and easy to use.
                          Each button is clearly labeled with the drum sound it
                          triggers, and the buttons are intuitively organized to
                          facilitate rhythm creation.`,
      //
      funtionality: `The Drum Machine is an interactive application that
                          allows users to play drum sounds. Each drum sound is
                          triggered by clicking a corresponding button or
                          pressing a specific key on the keyboard. The drum
                          sounds include a variety of drum beats and cymbals,
                          allowing users to create their own percussion music.
                          But in this case, I added sounds from the Zelda video
                          game, to make it a bit more different and fun.`,
